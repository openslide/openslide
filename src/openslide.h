 * @name Error Handling
 * A simple mechanism for detecting errors.
 *
 * Sometimes an unrecoverable error can occur that will invalidate the
 * OpenSlide object. (This is typically something like an I/O error or
 * data corruption.)  When such an error happens in an OpenSlide
 * object, the object will move terminally into an error state.
 *
 * While an object is in an error state, no OpenSlide functions will
 * have any effect on it except for openslide_close(). Functions
 * that are expected to return values will instead return an error
 * value, typically something like NULL or -1. openslide_read_region()
 * will clear its destination buffer instead of painting into
 * it. openslide_get_error() will return a non-NULL string containing
 * an error message. See the documentation for each function for
 * details on what is returned in case of error.
 *
 * This style of error handling allows programs written in C to check
 * for errors only when convenient, because the error state is
 * terminal and the OpenSlide functions return harmlessly when there
 * has been an error.
 *
 * If writing wrappers for OpenSlide in languages that support
 * exceptions, it is recommended that the error state be checked after
 * each call and converted into an exception for that language.
